  Gatsby and Vuepress are big players in the JAM ecosystem. If you're a React fan then you should try out Gatsby and Vuepress is for, well... Vue fans :joy:

  Both of these are really great choices if you want to build your own blog, site or anything else you might want to build with the JAM Stack! But this comes with its own issue, you have to do most of the actual the building. Both of these tools are essentially a low-level building block that can be used to put together your application.

  both projects have great documentation and absoultely amazing communities! Gatsby even has $3.8M in funding (whatever it means for an open source project to have funding). So you will probably have a good time following the documentation and getting started.

  If you don't want to start out from scratch you can find a number of Gatsby or Vuepress "starters" that are essentially demo projects that you can fork and make use of the setup, but as we all know, if you start a project by essentially forking upstream then you won't get any updates to that starter as they are released.

  And this is where we need a slightly different approach to see if we can make the whole process a bit more palitable to meer mortals like myself.

  Introducing Empress! Ember's answer to the JAM Stack! Empress has a fundementally different approach to building JAM Stack applications and I don't just mean because it's using Ember!

  Firstly there is no single Empress installable addon. instead Empress is essentially a set of "products" focused on a particular usecase
